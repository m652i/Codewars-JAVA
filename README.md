## Codewars-JAVA
Codewars practices, main JAVA.

*Edit Jan/17th : Added .java to the files so the code is color coded.*

**<8級> <---- 級 pronounced as Kyuu, means level.**



Place I go for Java practices.

The lower the number is, the higher the difficulty. 

>**8** being the easiest, **1** being the hardest. 

>(I believe there are no level past 1, but I could be wrong.)

Copying code over is from another site, so the uploads will be slower. 


Current completed level :

- [ ] level 1
- [ ] level 2
- [ ] level 3
- [ ] level 4
- [X] level 5
- [X] level 6
- [X] level 7
- [X] level 8



These are my solutions, there are voted better solutions on the website!

(But sometimes the top voted ones are just really short code, not necessarily the most efficient or the easiest to read)
